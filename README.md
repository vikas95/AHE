# Alignment Over Heterogeneous Embeddings for Question Answering - [Paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1274)

These codes are provided to reproduce the numbers mentioned in the paper on ARC dataset. 
AHE can be simply applied to any text similarity task. In question answering (QA), we have considered "question" as text 1 and "answer" as text 2. 

## Combining AHE with FLAIR library

We are working on combining AHE with FLAIR library because it is easier to generate - GloVe, BERT and FLAIR embeddings using FLAIR library. 

Please mail the first author - vikasy@email.arizona.edu  for any question. 

We will update this page once AHE is coupled with FLAIR library.
